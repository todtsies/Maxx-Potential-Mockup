  ## Description
  This is my final version our activity from Wednesday's session. Feel free to look through my code to help you get a deeper understanding of basic HTML and CSS! First, I downloaded and saved each image Maxx Potential offered. I then created my file set up which includes an index.html file, a style.css file, and an images folder that holds all of the images provided, plus the GIF for this README. I organized them so they were all at the root level. I used Bootstrap and an external stylesheet - this helps your code to not only be more organized and easier to read, but less repetitive. I broke down each section of the page (i.e. Navbar, Main, Section, and Footer) and began coding! I added comments and formatted my files at the end to offer a better understanding of each section of code.
